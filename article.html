            <p>The COVID-19 Pandemic has rocked the globe since the spring of 2020. During this two-year span, many countries across the globe have implemented quarantine and masking mandates to “curb” the spread of the virus. One of the most important trends governments and world leaders look at when deciding what restrictions to put in place is the percentage of tests positive. </p>

            <p>In the United States, the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic caused many challenges related to testing those who had symptoms. By late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had sent out COVID-19 test kits to 57 countries. Some countries across the globe such as South Korea had administered 65,000 tests. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) only did 459 tests by February 2020. </p>

            <p>Recently in early 2022, the Omicron variant continued to present challenges for testing across the globe. According to PBS, the Omicron variant created an unsustainable workload for the nation’s testing infrastructure. This led to stores being wiped of COVID-19 testing kits and many people unable to properly be diagnosed with the virus.</p>

            <p>A shortage in COVID testing kits makes it very difficult to properly put proper restrictions into place. At the beginning of the pandemic, a majority of tests administered came back positive. This is due to tests being prioritized for those with COVID-19 symptoms. High positive percentage rates always indicate more testing should be done.  </p>

            <p>Dr. Kyla Garret Wagner, an assistant professor of communications at the Newhouse School, believes that the United States government should be extra cautious with putting restrictions into place. She says science is “fluid and always changing” and thus the government needs to be prepared at all times. The volatile nature of COVID-19 numbers can once again be seen as in the United States the percentage of positive tests has gone up in recent weeks. However, it has constantly been below 5%. This makes sense as recently restrictions have been lowered such as those on public transportation. Lowering restrictions can lead to immediate rises in cases and may display that the country should re-enter into harsher restrictions and mandates. Dr. Garret Wagner says “the government needs to rely on the medical researchers” when looking at COVID-19 data and making public health decisions. </p>

            <p>More locally in the State of New York, different counties have had drastically different positive test percentages since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Many of the counties that have the highest number of recorded cases have the lowest percent positive. This is seen in the southern part of the state in New York City and Long Island. However, counties with little testing such as Central and Western New York have the highest percent of COVID-19 tests positive. In Onondaga county (the county which houses Syracuse University), the numbers for positive tests are some of the highest in the entire state.</p>

  <br></br>
            <p>At Syracuse University, the members of the COVID-19 office use the percent of tests positive in Onondaga County as a way to decide which mask level to remain in. The Universities website says that they “collaborate with local and New York State public health officials” when making adjustments to the Universities' COVID-19 restrictions. SU has four levels of masking (Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green). These masking zones have different restrictions that are lowered or heightened based on the COVID-19 data around the city and county. At the moment, the campus is in the “blue masking zone” meaning face masks are required during academic instruction and highly recommended during other campus events. </p>

            <p>Some problems with calculating the percent of tests positive both locally and worldwide are the different types of tests available. In the United States, different states use different tests such as the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or the Antigen tests. Because the Antigen test works rapidly, it could lead to many false positive and negative results. This skews the overall testing numbers and makes it difficult for medical experts to properly compile testing numbers. </p>

            <p>When states and countries are reposting testing numbers, they should not include Antigen or antibody tests. These tests are not used to detect whether somebody has an active COVID-19 infection. Instead, the test allows a person to know if they have once had the virus and contain antibodies to the virus. If these tests are included it can skew the overall testing numbers in a specific region and could lead to misrepresentation. Instead, Johns Hopkins University recommends that places worldwide create a separate total including Antigen tests that do not affect whether COVID-19 restrictions are put into place.</p>
